# hatagu_water1

A QGIS plugin to evaluate the importance of water distribution blocks based on the presence and attributes of critical facilities.

## Description

`hatagu_water1` allows users to calculate importance scores for polygon features (e.g., water supply blocks) by analyzing the facilities within them—such as evacuation centers, hospitals, and administrative offices.

Users can:
- Select a polygon layer (e.g., distribution blocks)
- Select a point layer containing facilities
- Set the facility types and assign weights
- Generate a new polygon layer with computed importance scores

This tool is useful for emergency planning, infrastructure management, and visualizing critical service areas in GIS.

## Features

- GUI-based layer and attribute selection
- Customizable weight settings for different facility types
- Score calculation and new layer output
- Compatible with QGIS 3.x

## Requirements

- QGIS 3.0 or higher
